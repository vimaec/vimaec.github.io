# TODO

* Ara3D.com clickable logo 
* Load times written to console
* Drag and drop capabilities
* If no canvas is provided create one (full-screen
* Don't auto-size canvas (I think?)
* Better default colors of plane and background. 
* Write a blog post it
* Export button, export code 
* Write NPM converters between file formats using Node.JS. 
* Control "auto-rotate"
* Convert every file
* Create a model list. 
* Output geometry stats 
* Stop rotating on click
* Fix the strange clipping behavior on the shadow maps
* CAmeras don't update 
* Write a Three.JS NPM unit test for the different file formats 
    * Load files, report the stats for each one. 
    * First copy the "OutputStats" code then actually load the Ara3D viewer library next
    * Look for a way to do an offline render using Three.JS
* TODO: the FPS stats console does not show anymore 
* Maybe limit (or redo) the color controls in the dat.Gui
* I would love if sourceMaps were generated .... of course I'm doing something weird.
* lots of examples 
* Why are styles not set correctly on my div
* More examples would be necessary 
* autoRotate doesn't update if changed. 
* Make stuff look as good as the 3D demo: https://css-tricks.com/creating-photorealistic-3d-graphics-web/
